# cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay

InSpec profile overlay to validate the secure configuration of Microsoft Windows 2012R2 Member Server against [DISA's](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/index.aspx) STIG Version 2 Release 14 tailored for [CMS ARS 3.1](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Info-Security-Library-Items/ARS-31-Publication.html).

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile overlay be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __winrm__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Running This Overlay
When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these instructions: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.cms.gov/ispg-dev/cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay.git
git clone https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-2012r2-memberserver-stig-baseline.git
cd cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay
bundle install
inspec exec ../cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay -t winrm://$winhostip --user 'Administrator' --password=Pa55w0rd --reporter cli json:windows-memberserver-overlay-results.json
```

For every successive run, in order to always have the latest version of the overlay and its dependent baseline profiles:
```
cd profiles/cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay
git pull
cd ../microsoft-windows-2012r2-memberserver-stig-baseline
git pull
cd ../cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay
bundle install
inspec exec ../cms-ars-3.1-high-microsoft-windows-2012r2-member-server-stig-overlay -t winrm://$winhostip --user 'Administrator' --password=Pa55w0rd --reporter cli json:windows-memberserver-overlay-results.json
```

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
